## Interest: 
- I am one of them who love to paint and draw.While taking about technical interest i like to spend time on creating html pages and to learn new technologies, as learning new technologies can help to stand out from the crowd.
 ## **Technical Background**
        - Languages: C, PYTHON, SQL, JAVA
        - Software : ANDROID STUDIO, MS OFFICE
        - Web designing tools: HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT
## Projects and Publication
### Project:
1) Signature verification and identification using deep convolutional neural networks
This project on signature verification and identification using convolutional neural networks in keras 
using tensorflow as backend verifies a signature whether the signature is genuine or forged and if the 
signature is genuine then identification details of that particular signature will be displayed i.e person 
name, email and address. As the system is using TensorFlow as backend and Keras a wrapper to it, 
this is secured from forgery because it requires the genuine signature and avoids forgery due to 
multiple iterations of signature check and the probabilities obtained will be matched.
### Publications:
1) “Deep Learning: Techniques and Applications”, Article published at Journal of Emerging
Technologies and Innovative Research (jetir) Volume 8 Issue 7 (July 2021).
2) “Artificial Intelligence the future”, Published at International Journal of Innovative Research in 
Engineering and Multidisciplinary Physical Sciences (ijirmps) Volume 9, Issue 3 (May-June 2021).
